# Project Template: React/Rails API

## Description

This project is built with a React frontend and Rails backend. Dog Tinder, named TinDog, features a swipe left/right click button for each dog user. Dog users host a profile of an image, bio, gender, age, relationship seeking status, and children status. Dogs that match will no longer see one another in the list of options but instead as matches, & dog that are "swiped left" will no longer appear as options for that logged in dog.
